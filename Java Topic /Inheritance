INHERITANCE :
The property to inherit the properties of other classes is called inheritance.
The best advantage of inheritance is Code Reusability.

1. Single Inheritance
2. Multilevel Inheritance
3. Multiple Inheritance

TYPES OF INHERITANCE :
1. Single Inheritance: In this Inheritance we have only one child class and one parent class.
• Parent class is known as the base class.
• Child class is known as the derived class.
2. Multi-level Inheritance: Multi-level Inheritance is just like Grandfather, Father and Son relationship, A class can
extend the property of another class and that another class extend the property of some other class, this is called
as Multi-level Inheritance.
3. Multiple Inheritance: When there is a single child class which extends the property of multiple parent classes
then it is called as multiple inheritance.
4. Hierarchical Inheritance: In the hierarchical Inheritance, there is only one parent class but multiple child classes.
5. Hybrid Inheritance: It is the combination of any two types of inheritance.
