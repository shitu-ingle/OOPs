POLYMORPHISM :
Poly means “Many” and morph means “Forms”;
The ability to acquire multiple forms is called Polymorphism.
Real-life example of polymorphism:
The real-life example of polymorphism can be “Umbrella” which can be used in rainy season to
protect us from rain and it can be also used in summer season to protect us from the heat
waves of sun.
Polymorphism are of two types :
1. Compile-time Polymorphism
2. Run-time Polymorphism

COMPILE TIME POLYMORPHISM :
Compile-time Polymorphism are of three types:
1. Function Overloading: When there are various functions with the same name but different
arguments in the same class then it is known as the function overloading.
2. Constructor Overloading: When there are various constructor with the same name but
different arguments then it is called as constructor overloading.
3. Operator Overloading: When a single operator can perform multiple operations, then it is
called operator overloading

RUN TIME POLYMORPHISM :
Run-time Polymorphism includes function overriding:
Function Overriding:
When there are two functions with the same name and same arguments but present in
different classes, one is present in parent class and other one is redefined in a child class, so this
process of redefining is called Function Overriding.
